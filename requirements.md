# Application Requirements

## Service (SVC) Requirements
- REQ-SVC-00001: [Performance] Minimal bandwidth usage on high-latency network mounts via 1MB header-only metadata extraction.
- REQ-SVC-00002: [Functionality] Hierarchical root path management with recursive normalization and proactive parenting.
- REQ-SVC-00003: [Performance] High-speed binary WebSocket protocol for image delivery to minimize serialization latency.
- REQ-SVC-00004: [Performance] Optimized preview generation using automatic sidecar JPG detection for RAW files.
- REQ-SVC-00005: [Functionality] Decoupled storage architecture using multiple SQLite databases for metadata and binary blobs.
- REQ-SVC-00006: [Functionality] Cross-stack type safety via automated Roslyn-based TypeScript interface generation.
- REQ-SVC-00007: [Performance] Just-in-time preview generation for missing cache entries to ensure seamless browsing.
- REQ-SVC-00008: [Functionality] Stable file and folder identification through proactive hierarchy reconstruction and xxHash64.
- REQ-SVC-00009: [Functionality] Reliable task management with integrated cancellation support for background operations.
- REQ-SVC-00010: [Functionality] Real-time state synchronization across all clients via persistent WebSocket broadcasting.
- REQ-SVC-00011: [Security] Secure path resolution logic to prevent unauthorized filesystem access or directory traversal.
